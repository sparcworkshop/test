      <h1>What tinyML can learn from Neuromorphic Engineering?</h1>

      

      <h2 class="second">Theme</h2>

      <p>tinyML is the convergence of machine learning algorithms with tiny embedded system (such as MCU, ASIC, FPGA); the focus of tinyML systems is to achieve low-latency, low power and low bandwidth ML models that can run in real-time. tinyML differs from mainstream machine learning in that it requires not only software expertise, but also embedded-hardware expertise. The human brain has been evolved to be the most optimal intelligent system in terms of power, performance, and area (PPA matrices) from an engineering perspective. Neuromorphic engineering community tries to leverage the nervous systems' fundamental principles, such as low power, adaptability, and fault tolerance.

        This workshop's focus is to find out, if we can leverage some of these neuromorphic principles to build small intelligent systems, which can run on tinyML embedded platforms.</p>
